## <p align="center">Key Insights

1. Month-to-month Contract type and absence of Tech support are the biggest causes for customers churning.
2. Though some other services like payment type, intrnet service, online security, online backup, paper billing, device protection and multiple lines are poorly available to the churning customers, these services are strongly influenced by availability of Tech support.
3. On average most customers who churned had higher monthly charges.

## <p align="center">Recommendations

1. Prioratize TECH SUPPORT making it more readily available to the customers.
2. Offer incentives for longer contracts like discounted rates, free services, or additional features.
